    <p id="intro"> 
        Hi, my name is Chia-Ling. I was a high school Chinese literature teacher in Taiwan. Additionally, I'm devoted to human rights education, working on how to engage teenagers to be aware of their rights as well as the injustice around the world. I enjoy this job deeply. To see students learn to care and to speak up for themselves or others is one of the most wonderdul thing in my life. </p>
    <p id="motivation">
        2019 summer, to enrich my career, I started my exploration to web programming. I believe that this skill is crititcal if I want to expand the influence of my work because it could help me connect, not only to more students, but also to more people with the same educational goal. With no background in computer science, for now it has been fun for me to learn how we communicate with computers using precise and strutural sets of rules. Look forward to the class.</p>
